		<img src="./images/process1.jpg" alt="Screenshot of old site" class=" process-img"><img src="./images/process2.jpg"
		 alt="Screenshot of old site 2" class=" process-img">
		<p>This is how my site looked at the end of the final lab. It basically had everything we learned on one page, but
			did not act as a true home page.
		</p>

		<p class="inner-sub">Planning before sketching:</p>
		<img src="./images/process6.jpg" alt="List of pages needed" class=" process-sketch-img">
		<p>Before sketching layouts, I decided what pages I wanted to include in my site. Although only 3 total pages were
			needed, I decided to added a Connect page. Since it is supposed to be a portfolio/professional site, I thought that
			there should probably be a way to find my contact info.</p>

		<p class="inner-sub">New homepage sketch:</p>
		<img src="./images/process3.jpg" alt="Sketch of homepage layout" class=" process-sketch-img">
		<p>I wanted my new homepage to look more clean and useful. First I got rid of all the useless stuff, like the table
			and video. Then, instead of having a generic banner image, I decided to
			have a carousel to highlight other parts of the site, which also allowed me to get rid of the 4 features. Next I
			decided to move the navbar to the top to make the page less cluttered. Lastly, I redid the footer so it has a
			purpose, to link to my other social media.
		</p>

		<p class="inner-sub">Projects sketch:</p>
		<img src="./images/process4.jpg" alt="Sketch of projects layout" class=" process-sketch-img">
		<p>I wanted to share 4 of my projects, so I decided to make 4 separate blocks for each. This allowed my to neatly
			display preview images and put the title and descriptions of the projects directly under them. I decided to just put
			a text header for the inner page, as the projects page already contained 4 images, and it would be more difficult to
			find a image that related to the 4 projects.
		</p>

		<p class="inner-sub">Connect sketch:</p>
		<img src="./images/process5.jpg" alt="Sketch of connect layout" class=" process-sketch-img">
		<p>For the connections page, I wanted it to be simple and easy to understand. I decided to put icons of the social
			media and my name on them. I then added links to the images and text.
		</p>

		<p class="inner-sub">After creating the layouts for each page:</p>
		<p>Sitewide:</p>
		<p>Sitewide, I decided to change the color scheme. Previously, the header and footer were lighter colors. I decided
			to make them both black to improve the overall contrast of my site, making it more accessible. I also added new
			fonts to make my site look more modern. Lastly, I added hover effects to all the header links to make the site look
			nicer.
		</p>

		<p>Home: </p>
		<p>After creating the main layout for the homepage, I wanted to make it look a bit nicer. I decided to do this by
			making the carousel more interactive by making the image turn black and white when hovered.
